a boy rides a bike to the store. the store owner doesn't want to sell him anything
but the boy must buy a banana
a banana is very important for his health 
and he is also very poor 
and then the store owner makes a deal that if the boy can write him a poem he can have all da bananayes

and so the boy composes
	"Roses are Red
	Violets are Blue
			
			I'm too good a writer
			to be writing for you"

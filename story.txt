One day,a boy rides a bike to the store.
the store owner doesn't want to sell him anything.
but the boy must buy a banana.
a banana is very important for his health. 
and he is also very poor. 
and then the store owner makes a deal that if the boy can write him a poem he can have all da bananayes.

and so the boy composes;
	"Roses are Red
	Violets are Blue
			
			I'm too good a writer
			to be writing for you"
			
The owner liked the boy's story and gave him "all da bananayes."
The boy walks out of the store with a smile, until he realizes that someone stole his bike. 
He cries, "GODDAMN IT!"

When he was thinking about calling the police, he heard someone shouting at him.
He turned back and saw his friend and the bike he was worried about.
Then he realized that it was not his bike; it was the bike he borrowed from his friend six months ago.
Now his friend was trying to retrieve the bike and was very unhappy about the bike.
He said to the boy, "How can you make this bike so dirty that I don't even want it anymore?"
Hearing the words, the boy offered a deal, "Since you don't want this bike anymore, what about you leave this bike to me and I write a super awsome poem for you?"

One day,a boy rides a bike to the store.
the store owner doesn't want to sell him anything.
but the boy must buy a banana.
a banana is very important for his health. 
and he is also very poor. 
and then the store owner makes a deal that if the boy can write him a poem he can have all da bananayes.

and so the boy composes;
	"Roses are Red
	Violets are Blue
			
			I'm too good a writer
			to be writing for you"
			
The owner liked the boy's story and gave him "all da bananayes."
The boy walks out of the store with a smile, until he realizes that someone stole his bike. 
He cries, "GODDAMN IT!"
